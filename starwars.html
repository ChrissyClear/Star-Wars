                            Darth Vader is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. The character is the
                            primary
                            antagonist in the original trilogy and, as Anakin Skywalker, is one of the primary
                            protagonists
                            throughout the prequel trilogy. Star Wars creator George Lucas has collectively referred to
                            the
                            first
                            six episodic films of the franchise as "the tragedy of Darth Vader". He has become one of
                            the
                            most
                            iconic villains in popular culture, and has been listed among the greatest villains and
                            fictional
                            characters ever. <br><br>
                            Originally a slave on Tatooine, Anakin Skywalker is a Jedi prophesied to bring balance to
                            the
                            Force.
                            He is lured to the dark side of the Force by Chancellor Sheev Palpatine / Darth Sidious and
                            becomes
                            a
                            Sith Lord, assuming the title of Darth Vader. After a lightsaber battle with his former
                            mentor
                            Obi-Wan
                            Kenobi on Mustafar, in which he is severely injured, Vader is transformed into a cyborg. He
                            then
                            serves the Galactic Empire for over two decades as its chief enforcer. Vader ultimately
                            redeems
                            himself by saving his son, Luke Skywalker, and killing Palpatine, sacrificing his own life
                            in
                            the
                            process.[5] He is also the secret husband of Padm√© Amidala, the biological father of
                            Princess
                            Leia,
                            and the grandfather of Kylo Ren (Ben Solo). In the non-canonical Star Wars Legends
                            continuity,
                            he is
                            also the grandfather of Ben Skywalker, his eponym Anakin Solo, Jaina Solo and Darth Caedus
                            (Jacen
                            Solo), and the great-grandfather of Allana Solo. <br><br>

                            Anakin Skywalker was a legendary Force-sensitive human male who was a Jedi Knight of the
                            Galactic
                            Republic and the prophesied Chosen One of the Jedi Order, destined to bring balance to the
                            Force.
                            Also known as "Ani" during his childhood, Skywalker earned the moniker "Hero With No Fear"
                            from
                            his
                            accomplishments in the Clone Wars. His alter ego, Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith,
                            was
                            created when Skywalker turned to the dark side of the Force, pledging his allegiance to the
                            Sith
                            Lord Darth Sidious at the end of the Republic Era. <br><br>
                            Anakin Skywalker was one of the most powerful Jedi and Sith in galactic history. The Force
                            was
                            especially strong in the Skywalker bloodline, which culminated in Anakin's grandson, Ben
                            Solo,
                            Organa's son who was born by the end of the Galactic Civil War in 5 ABY. Solo would turn to
                            the
                            dark
                            side as well, becoming the dark warrior Kylo Ren during the rise of the First Order. Like
                            his
                            grandfather, however, Solo found redemption by sacrificing his life for the love of
                            another‚Äîthe
                            Jedi
                            apprentice Rey, who heard Skywalker's voice telling her to restore the balance, as he once
                            had,
                            during the Battle of Exegol in 35 ABY. Solo's death ended the Skywalker bloodline, although
                            Rey,
                            the
                            granddaughter of Sidious, rejected her true heritage and took their surname to honor their
                            legacy.

                            The one story the prequels tell particularly well doesn't really involve the corruption of
                            Anakin
                            Skywalker; rather, it's the one about how the shadowy leader of a religious cult dismantled
                            the
                            republic from within. <br><br>

                            Senator Sheev Palpatine, a.k.a. ‚ÄúDarth Sidious,‚Äù only registers in the original trilogy as
                            ‚ÄúDarth
                            Vader's boss,‚Äù but in Phantom through Sith he's the evil no one recognizes until it's too
                            late.
                            He
                            starts out as a deceptively conscientious politician, who then provokes a war, convinces his
                            colleagues to build him a clone army, gets himself named Supreme Chancellor as an emergency
                            measure, and forges an Empire ‚Äî all legally. <br><br>

                            In one of the most loaded images of the whole series, Palpatine flings congressional
                            box-seats
                            at
                            Yoda, showing how he uses democracy as a weapon while simultaneously destroying it. <br><br>

                            Sheev Palpatine is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise, created by George
                            Lucas.
                            Initially credited as the Emperor in the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back, he is also known
                            by
                            his Sith name, Darth Sidious. <br><br>

                            The character appears in each trilogy in the nine-film Skywalker saga, in which he is
                            portrayed
                            by
                            Ian McDiarmid and serves as the primary antagonist. <br><br>

                            In the original trilogy, Palpatine is depicted as Emperor of the Galactic Empire and the
                            master
                            of
                            Darth Vader. In the prequel trilogy, he is portrayed as a charismatic politician‚Äîand,
                            secretly,
                            a
                            Sith Lord ‚Äîwho orchestrates the Clone Wars, all but exterminates the Jedi Order, ends the
                            Galactic
                            Republic, and seduces Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to the dark side of the Force. <br><br>

                            In The Rise of Skywalker (2019), the final film in the sequel trilogy, Palpatine is revealed
                            to
                            be
                            the mastermind behind the First Order and the creator of its former leader, Snoke, as well
                            as
                            the
                            grandfather of protagonist Rey. <br><br>

                            Since the release of Return of the Jedi in 1983, Palpatine has become a widely recognized
                            symbol
                            of evil in popular culture, and since the prequel films, also one of sinister deception and
                            the
                            subversion of democracy. Aside from the films, Palpatine appears in various canon and
                            non-canon
                            Star Wars media. <br><br>

                            Created by George Lucas <br>
                            First Appearance: The Phantom Menace (1999) <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <P class="text-info">
                            All the scorn heaped on The Phantom Menace obscures how good Liam Neeson is as an honorable
                            Jedi
                            knight who mentors young Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) in the ways of the Force. <br><br>

                            In Qui-Gon Jinn, we can see the wise-elder warrior that Kenobi would grow to become, and
                            Neeson
                            (who had yet to make the transition to avenging-angel action star) brought just the right
                            amount
                            of Zen gravitas to his ass-kicking role. <br><br>

                            Although the prequels were about Anakin's character
                            arc, the first installment really belongs to this character, who's trying to maintain a
                            fragile
                            peace across the galaxy while unseen forces are conspiring to tear it apart. <br><br>

                            That's what makes his death at the hands of Darth Maul especially tragic: It's not just
                            Qui-Gon
                            who's dying but also his era's sense of nobility. <br><br>

                            Qui-Gon Jinn (/'kwaig…ín/) is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise, played by
                            Liam
                            Neeson. <br><br>

                            He is a main character in the prequel film trilogy, serving as the protagonist of The
                            Phantom
                            Menace (1999). <br><br>

                            Within the fictional Star Wars universe, Qui-Gon mentors Obi-Wan Kenobi, and is a powerful
                            and
                            wise, yet controversial Jedi Master, who has many uncommon beliefs regarding The Force.

                            Darth Sidious, born Sheev Palpatine and also known simply as the Emperor, was a human male
                            Dark Lord of the Sith and Emperor of the Galactic Empire, ruling from 19 BBY to 4 ABY.
                            <br><br>

                            Rising to power in the Galactic Senate as the senator of Naboo, the secretive Sith Lord
                            cultivated two identities, Sidious and Palpatine, using both to further his political career
                            and deceive his way into accomplishing his goal. <br><br>

                            He orchestrated the fall of the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order through the Clone Wars,
                            and then established his reign over the galaxy which lasted until his death at the Battle of
                            Endor. However, the dark side of the Force gave rise to powers which allowed the Emperor to
                            return from the grave. <br><br>

                            Like a lot of good mentors, Yoda doesn't make things easy on his pupils, expecting them to
                            figure out
                            things on their own rather than spoon-feeding them important life lessons. (How else to
                            explain a
                            character who refuses to speak in the traditional subject-verb order?) <br><br>

                            Character overview: <br>
                            Grand Master Yoda is among the oldest, most stoic, and most powerful Jedi Masters in the
                            Star Wars
                            universe. <br><br>

                            George Lucas opted to have many details of the character's life history remain unknown.
                            Yoda's
                            race and home world have not been named in any official media, canonical or otherwise, and
                            he is merely
                            said to be of a "species unknown" by the Star Wars Databank. <br><br>
                            Yoda's characteristic speech patterns were conceived by Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan, and
                            developed by Oz. Academic syntacticians have found them somewhat inconsistent, but have
                            extrapolated that they possess object-subject-verb word order, making them anastrophic.
                            <br><br>

                            The films and Expanded Universe reveal that Yoda had a hand in training almost every Jedi
                            Master in the
                            galaxy. In the Star Wars prequel films, he instructs several younglings in the Jedi Temple
                            before they
                            are assigned to a master. In The Empire Strikes Back he mentions that he had been training
                            Jedi "for 800
                            years", which means he must have been a Master Jedi for quite some time before that.

                            Forgive Count Dooku's dismal name; even his Sith alias, Darth Tyranus, inspires shrugs more
                            than fear. <br>
                            But embrace Christopher Lee, who brings this master swordsman of the one-percent to life
                            with the technicolor gravitas of Hammer horror. Dooku's best machinations as a Separatist
                            leader take place off screen; Lee's Middle-Earth training means his lightsaber skills,
                            however, are devastating. <br>
                            The Count's final battle with Anakin and Obi-Wan is among the best action sequences of the
                            Prequels, and his death ‚Äî a vicious execution at the hands of greasy-haired Anakin ‚Äî is a
                            key moment in the young Jedi's fall to the dark side. <br><br>

                            franchise.
                            Within
                            the original trilogy, Obi-Wan is a Jedi Master as a supporting character and is
                            portrayed
                            by
                            British
                            actor Alec Guinness. <br><br>
                            In the later-released prequel trilogy, a younger version of the character serves as one
                            of
                            the
                            two
                            main protagonists, alongside Anakin Skywalker, and is portrayed by Scottish actor Ewan
                            McGregor.
                            In
                            the original trilogy he is introduced as Ben Kenobi, an alias he uses whilst in hiding
                            from the
                            Empire. <br><br>
                            He is a mentor to Luke Skywalker, to whom he introduces the ways of the Jedi. After
                            sacrificing
                            himself in a duel against Darth Vader, Obi-Wan guides Luke through the Force in his
                            fight
                            against
                            the Galactic Empire. <br><br>
                            In the prequel trilogy, set two decades earlier, he is initially a Padawan (apprentice)
                            to
                            Jedi
                            Master Qui-Gon Jinn, and later mentor and friend of Luke's father Anakin, who falls to
                            the
                            dark
                            side
                            of the Force and becomes Vader. The character briefly appears in the sequel trilogy as a
                            disembodied
                            voice, speaking to protagonist Rey. He is frequently featured as a main character in
                            various
                            other
                            Star Wars media, including the television miniseries Obi-Wan Kenobi, in which McGregor
                            reprises
                            the
                            role.

                        <P class="text-info"> Darth Maul/Maul: <br>
                            Real talk: Darth Maul was a pioneer. A man of few words, the Sith Lord with the Rorschach
                            ink blot of a face was the
                            first guy to break the mold on light-sabers, his double-bladed weapon paving the way for
                            Kylo Ren's cross-sword beam
                            in The Force Awakens. Even more importantly, he also inspired millions of Star Wars fans to
                            ignore the fact that the
                            most anticipated movie of all time was borderline unwatchable. <br><br>

                            Refreshingly comfortable in his own skin for a series in which the villains are so often
                            hiding their face or cloaking
                            their true intentions, Darth Maul radiates pure evil through his jaundiced yellow eyeballs;
                            George Lucas has described
                            the big bad of The Phantom Menace as ‚Äúa figure from one of
                            his darkest nightmares.‚Äù (Which kind of makes you wonder where Jar Jar Binks came from.)
                            <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-light">
                            In the fictional universe of Star Wars, Maul is a member of the Zabrak species hailing from
                            Dathomir who is abducted
                            by Sidious as a child and trained in the ways of the dark side of the Force. <br><br>

                            He kills Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn on Naboo before being bisected by his apprentice, Obi-Wan,
                            and presumed dead.
                            <br><br>

                            Surviving thanks to his mastery of the Force, Maul replaces the lower half of his body with
                            cybernetics and is driven
                            insane over a decade of isolation until his brother, Savage Opress, finds him during the
                            Clone Wars. <br><br>

                            Once his mind and body are restored by the Nightsister Mother Talzin, Maul obsessively seeks
                            revenge against Obi-Wan,
                            culminating in an alliance of various crime syndicates, a takeover of Mandalore, and the
                            murder of Obi-Wan's lover,
                            Duchess Satine Kryze. <br><br>

                            Though he is captured by Sidious for becoming a rival, Maul escapes before the Republic is
                            replaced by the Galactic
                            Empire. He renounces his Sith title of "Darth", rebuilds his criminal organization, and
                            meets Ezra Bridger on the Sith
                            world of Malachor years later. <br><br>

                            Maul uses Ezra to track Obi-Wan to Tatooine, where the two old rivals have a final
                            confrontation that ends in Maul's
                            death. <br><br>

                            Originally a farmer on Tatooine living with his uncle and aunt, Luke becomes a pivotal
                            figure in the Rebel Alliance's struggle against the Galactic Empire. Even after he's
                            mastered The Force, he still seems like one of us. <br><br>

                            Amidala, Luke is the twin brother of Rebellion leader Princess Leia and eventual

                            Luke trains to be a Jedi under Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda and rebuilds the Jedi
                            Order. He later trains his nephew Ben Solo and mentors Rey. Though Luke dies at the end of
                            The Last Jedi, he returns as a Force spirit in The Rise of Skywalker, encouraging Rey to
                            face her grandfather, the resurrected Emperor Palpatine. At the end of the film, the spirits
                            of Luke and Leia give Rey their blessing to adopt the Skywalker surname and continue their
                            family's legacy.

                            The pivotal player in a decades-old interplanetary struggle for democracy, Luke is both
                            compassionate and temperamental ‚Äî and never sure if he's using his powers the right way.

                            Anyone who thinks of Star Wars as a simplistic story of good and evil needs to look more
                            closely at the young Skywalker, who always seems to be on the brink of turning dark, even
                            when he's saving the day. <br><br>

                        <P class="text-info"> Storm Trooper: <br>
                            According to Star Wars lore, Imperial stormtroopers are men (and in rare cases, women) who
                            have been recruited (or
                            conscripted) at a young age to serve as expendable foot soldiers of the Empire, gradually
                            replacing clone troopers as
                            their accelerated aging forces them to retire. <br><br>

                            These recruits are trained at Imperial Academies spread out across the galaxy where they
                            undergo intense conditioning
                            that instills fierce loyalty, strict discipline and ruthless efficiency while removing any
                            sense of individualism or
                            empathy. <br><br>

                            As the backbone of the Imperial Army, stormtroopers are dreaded for their brutality,
                            carrying out atrocities in the
                            name of Emperor Palpatine, and their fanaticism, engaging the enemy with no regard to
                            casualties. <br><br>

                            Inevitably, some use their position for personal gain against a civilian population too
                            terrified to resist. <br><br>

                            However, inconsistencies in academy standards led to stormtroopers of varying combat skill
                            and ability. <br><br>
                        </P>
                        <p class="text-light">
                            After subduing any remaining Separatist holdouts left over from the Clone Wars,
                            stormtroopers primarily serve as an
                            internal security and peacekeeping force until the Galactic Civil War where they start to
                            engage the Rebel Alliance in
                            large-scale battles. <br><br>

                            Unable to conscript millions of soldiers to fill its stormtrooper ranks, yet unwilling to
                            switch back to using rapidly
                            produced clone troopers, First Order stormtroopers are bred, trained and indoctrinated from
                            birth, raised their entire
                            lives for no other purpose. <br><br>

                            First Order soldiers and crews have constantly trained for combat in war games and
                            simulations, making them much more
                            effective one-on-one than the endless waves of stormtrooper conscripts fielded by the
                            Galactic Empire. <br><br>

                            First Order stormtroopers are regularly put through mental indoctrination and propaganda
                            programs, to make sure that
                            they remain fanatically loyal and never hesitate or question orders. <br><br>

                            Being taken from their families at birth, these soldiers are not even given individual names
                            for themselves but merely
                            serial numbers, such as "FN-2187".

                            When studio heads pay lip service to the importance of creating ‚Äúproactive‚Äù female
                            protagonists for
                            their blockbusters, it shows how far Hollywood remains behind Lucas' conception of Princess
                            Leia from almost 40 years ago. <br><br>

                            Luke and Han may be the central heroes of the original trilogy; it's Leia, however,
                            who provides its heart, which doesn't mean she isn't capable with a blaster. <br><br>

                            The late, great Carrie Fisher turns her every line of dialogue into a mocking jab, refusing
                            to let the smart, spitfire character settle into simply being a Death Star
                            damsel-in-distress. <br><br>

                            It's impossible to erase the fact that she and Luke kiss in the first film (and, er, the
                            second film), but what's great about her love story with Han in The Empire Strikes Back is
                            that it feels like a relationship of equals, the two strongest-willed people in the galaxy
                            realizing they're nuts about one another. <br><br>

                            As for the racy slave number from Return of the Jedi that jump-started a generation of boys'
                            sexual awakening, just remember she managed to kill Jabba while rocking it. We miss you,

                            Return of the Jedi (1983; mentioned in original theatrical versions of preceding films)
                            Six Against the Galaxy (1977; comic)

                            Jabba the Hutt (full name: Jabba Desilijic Tiure) is a fictional character and minor
                            antagonist in the Star Wars
                            franchise. This repulsive, slovenly space slug whose response to mortal terror is a cold,
                            deep laugh is, without a
                            doubt, the finest Star Wars portrait of the id. <br><br>

                            Jabba's Palace, a den of sin and sadism, is a wailin' time for those lucky enough to be in
                            the gangster's good graces.
                            <br><br>

                            But its endless party is powered by a Caligula-like cycle of mania in which prized
                            courtesans are fed to monstrous
                            pit-dwelling beasts as an after-dinner entertainment; that he meets his end via the very
                            chains he uses for his
                            concubines is justice. <br><br>
                        </P>
                        <p class="text-light">
                            In the films, Jabba is a powerful crime lord on the planet Tatooine, who is of the Hutt
                            species. He is obese and often
                            exemplifies his characterizations of lust and greed by having slave alien girls in his
                            throne room. <br><br>

                            He places a bounty on smuggler Han Solo, sending several bounty hunters to capture him.
                            <br><br>

                            Boba Fett captures Han Solo, Darth Vader freezes him, and after Boba Fett delivers him Jabba
                            puts Han Solo on display
                            in his palace. <br><br>

                            Later, Princess Leia comes to save Han but is captured by Jabba, who turns her into a slave.
                            <br><br>

                            While Luke Skywalker comes to rescue them, Leia chokes Jabba to death by wrapping the chain
                            connected to her around
                            his neck. <br><br>

                        <P class="text-info"> Padm√© Amidala: <br>
                            Almost unmentioned in the original trilogy, Luke and Leia's mom plays a major role in the
                            prequels: going
                            undercover as her own handmaiden in The Phantom Menace, fighting in a gladiatorial arena in
                            Attack of the
                            Clones, and trying to save her husband's soul in Revenge of the Sith. <br><br>

                            She's right there with the boys, instead of worriedly wringing her hands back home. (Okay,
                            maybe there's a little of that in Sith.) And as an early supporter of Senator Palpatine's
                            plans, Padm√© Amidala helps set in motion everything that befalls her, making her a lot like
                            her son: a hero whose impulse to help sometimes worsens things. <br><br>

                            Her combat skills are explored further through the Star Wars universe. In Star Wars: Episode
                            II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones she fights squads of battle droids with hand-to-hand combat and a
                            blaster. Furthermore, in the film Amidala is shown to be quite physically impressive, and
                            given her larger size compared to Leia uses strength more often in combat. In fact she is
                            able to keep up with Jedi in speed and take huge falls with minimal damage. She is an expert
                            markswoman; in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode "Assassin", she outguns bounty hunter
                            Aurra Sing. <br><br>

                            He's ‚Äújust a simple man trying to make my way in the universe,‚Äù but Jango Fett is legion ‚Äî
                            literally. <br><br>

                            Through extensive cloning, the bounty hunter behind the blue Mandalorian armor is the basis
                            not only for his
                            better-known ‚Äúson‚Äù Boba Fett, but for each and every trooper who gives Attack of the Clones
                            its title. <br><br>

                            From his knock-down drag-out brawl with Obi-Wan to their high-speed asteroid-field chase to
                            his decapitation by Mace
                            Windu's blade, he's a key part of the film's best action sequences. <br><br>

                            Kudos to Kiwi actor Temuera Morrison, who gives the character rough-hewn gangster gravitas.
                            <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-light">
                            Jango is covered in a sleek armored suit that conceals his scarred face, largely based on
                            Boba Fett's iconic outfit
                            (designed by Joe Johnston) from the original trilogy. <br><br>

                            His suit was initially planned to be white to match the concept art for Boba Fett, but this
                            was changed to silver and
                            blue, in contrast to Boba's green, red, and orange. <br><br>

                            Jango also uniquely has thigh, shin, and spat armor, as well as a comparative lack of
                            accessories and trophies.

                            ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù <br><br>

                            It's the galaxy's most notorious response to a proclamation of amore, but Han Solo is far
                            more than a smug swashbuckler. First appearing in the original trilogy, Han Solo and his
                            first mate Chewbacca are smugglers
                            who are hired by Ben Kenobi and Luke Skywalker to transport them to Alderaan so they can
                            deliver the stolen plans for the Death Star.
                            <br><br>

                            The scoundrel-turned Rebel leader may not be George Lucas's most unique creation, but the
                            Falcon's scrappy flyboy is the original trilogy's most vital asset. <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-light">
                            Harrison Ford's classic masculinity and lopsided grin, worn with the casual flair of a man
                            utterly at ease in the galaxy, made him a premiere heartthrob and the lifeblood of the
                            franchise's holy trinity.
                            <br><br>

                            Although initially unwilling to join the Rebel Alliance in their fight against the Galactic
                            Empire, he eventually does so and in the process falls in love with Princess Leia, whom he
                            eventually marries, becoming
                            Luke's brother in-law.
                            <br><br>

                            Beyond the charm, the funky ship, and the ‚Äúwho shot first?‚Äù arguments (Han did, of course,
                            end of story), the Correllian smuggler's own conflicts make him the saga's most complex
                            character.
                            <br><br>

                            Starry-eyed Luke instantly embraces the Force and the urgent drama of the Rebellion. Han
                            takes some convincing, just as we do. In The Empire Strikes Back, still the series'
                            high-water mark, Solo blossoms as a
                            flawed hero grappling with opposing urges. <br><br>

                            The deep-rooted survival instinct that drives his headstrong cockiness is shaken by love for
                            Leia and the moral imperative of the Rebellion. Han's intuition, skill, and passion fly us
                            through the trilogy's twists like the Falcon threading the needle of an asteroid field. Just
                            don't ever tell him the odds. <br><br>
                        </p>

                            In the sequel trilogy set decades later, Solo joins forces with scavenger Rey and former
                            stormtrooper Finn to help them and the Resistance in their fight against the First Order,
                            whose forces are led by Supreme Leader Snoke and Kylo Ren, the latter of whom is his and
                            Leia's son, Ben Solo who fell to the dark side of the force, which caused him and Leia to
                            separate. <br><br>

                            Han is killed by his son but eventually returns as a Force vision to his son and helps
                            redeem him back to the light side of the force. <br><br>

                            First appearance Clone Wars- "Chapter 20" (2004) <br><br>

                        <P class="text-info"> General Grievous: <br>
                            His name sounds like a Victorian medical condition, but this evil cyborg one of the more
                            complex villains in Revenge
                            of the Sith. Though mostly robotic, there's just enough failing organic matter in this bad
                            guy to keep him hunched
                            over and hacking. But when it's time to face-off against Obi-Wan he shakes off his cloak to
                            reveal an extra set of
                            arms and a knack for wielding lightsabers. (And spinning them like brightly-lit windmills.)
                            <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-light">
                            Unable to best him using laser swords, Kenobi tears open Grievous' chest to fire blasters at
                            his shriveled internal
                            organs until fire spews from his eyes. <br><br>

                            Grievous' cyborg body was specifically designed to rival the abilities of the Jedi. Standing
                            at 7 ft 1 in (216 cm),
                            his imposing presence serves to instill fear in his opponents to give him a psychological
                            advantage in battle.
                            <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-info">
                            While he is not Force-sensitive, Grievous has been trained in all forms of lightsaber combat
                            by Count Dooku. Each of
                            his mechanical arms can separate in half, allowing him to wield four lightsabers at once to
                            overwhelm his enemies. His
                            cybernetic enhancements give him exceptional strength, speed and reflexes to outmaneuver
                            Force-users and even the
                            Force itself. <br><br>
                        </P>
                        <p class="text-light">
                            In spite of Grievous' physical and acrobatic prowess, Dooku has advised him to retreat
                            should he lose the elements of
                            surprise and intimidation, and thus his advantage, in a fight against the Force-sensitive
                            Jedi. Grievous often heeds
                            his mentor's advice and becomes known as one of the Jedi's most elusive adversaries during
                            the Clone Wars. <br><br>

                            The quintessential loyal buddy and irascible sidekick, Chewbacca is the Wookie you want next
                            to you in the foxhole ‚Äî or, more likely, as your copilot in the Millennium Falcon. The fact
                            that no one in the audience knew what Chewie was ever saying was part of the character's
                            appeal. <br><br>

                            Chewbacca speaks only in his native language, Shyriiwook (which sounds like animal sound
                            growls); he is able to understand English, but is physically unable to speak it. <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-light">
                            Everybody in the Star Wars universe understood his moans and growls, which helped make the
                            movies seem exotic, multicultural and inclusive in a deeply comforting way. Of course, the
                            irony was that the franchise's tallest, most fearsome wild animal was, in actuality, the
                            biggest softie at heart. <br><br>

                            It's his anguished cry when Han Solo gets put into carbonite that makes that indelible
                            sequence from The Empire Strikes Back so gut-wrenching: He's losing his best friend, and you
                            feel his pain. <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-info">
                            Chewbacca, a 200-year-old wookiee, becomes a young Han Solo's companion after they both
                            escape Imperial captivity on Mimban. After a series of adventures on Vandor and Kessel,
                            Chewbacca embarks on the smuggling trade, serving as Han's co-pilot on the Millennium Falcon
                            for the rest of Han's life. <br><br>

                            Standing 8 feet (2.4 m) tall, Chewbacca is covered with long hair and wears only a
                            bandolier. His weapon of choice is the Wookiee bowcaster (a crossbow-shaped directed-energy
                            weapon). <br><br>

                            Chewbacca was named one of the "greatest sidekicks" in film history by Entertainment Weekly.

                            Bib Fortuna is a member of the Twi'lek species, humanoids distinguished by the pair of long
                            tentacular appendages that
                            protrude from the back of their heads, which are known as lekku. Fortuna's dialogue in the
                            film is delivered in
                            Huttese, the fictional language also spoken by Jabba.<br><br>

                            Fortuna works as the majordomo and chief aide for Jabba the Hutt, a slug-like alien and one
                            of the most powerful crime
                            lords in the galaxy. In this capacity, Fortuna controls most operations within Jabba's
                            palace on the desert planet of
                            Tatooine. Among these duties are welcoming visitors who come to the palace, and vetting them
                            before they appear before
                            Jabba. <br><br>

                            complex prison break for Han Solo, the sniveling Twi'lek did an ace job of keeping the
                            debauchery and illegality of
                            the Palace running smoothly. <br><br>

                            considering his given name. And being the obsequious slime that he was, he somehow survived
                            the battle on Jabba's

                            Fortuna is the first Twi'lek character to appear in Star Wars, although the species did not

                            machine speech for the audience. C-3PO is originally the property of the captain on the

                            children; C-3PO often following R2-D2 around, and R2-D2 needing C-3PO to translate for
                            him.[d] When R2-D2 is damaged in the Battle of Yavin, C-3PO offers to donate any mechanical

                            kill his own father) but still prone to temper tantrums that leave his underlings running
                            for cover. A fascinating study in contradictions. <br><br>

                            Kylo Ren is the chosen name of Ben Solo, the child of original Star Wars trilogy characters
                            Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa.

                        <P class="text-info"> Boba Fett: <br>
                            Everyone's favorite intergalactic bounty hunter made his first canonical appearance in The
                            Empire Strikes Back,
                            chasing down Han Solo for Jabba the Hutt. <br><br>

                            But even before that, Boba Fett was well-known to the Star Wars hardcore, who'd seen the
                            character march in a
                            California parade and pop up in animated form in the notorious Star Wars Holiday Special ‚Äî
                            both in 1978. <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-light">
                            Jango's little boy-clone was a hit before he'd even really done anything on the big screen.
                            And given that he's barely
                            in the original trilogy, some may wonder why he's so popular. <br><br>

                            So we'll say it again: Intergalactic. Bounty. Hunter. Throw in the armor and the rocket
                            launcher, and it's no wonder
                            that Lucas felt compelled to make the Fett family so integral to the prequels. Some
                            characters demand to get off the
                            side of the stage and into the thick of the action. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-info">
                            The character needed to be designed quickly, as Lucas had agreed for him to be featured in
                            the Star Wars Holiday
                            Special later that year. The character's design stemmed from initial concepts for Darth
                            Vader, who was originally
                            conceived as a rogue bounty hunter. <br><br>

                            While Vader became less of a mercenary and more of a dark knight, the bounty hunter concept
                            remained, and Fett became
                            "an equally villainous" but "less conspicuous" character. <br><br>

                            Alliance, because of his encounter with the Rebel officers the alliance helped destroy the

                            Wicket is the most prominently featured Ewok in Return of The Jedi. During his travels, he
                            encounters Princess Leia in the forest. He helps her to the relative safety of his village,
                            and notices her courage and compassion. Wicket has good knowledge of the terrain of Endor,
                            leading him to be essential during the Rebellion's attack on the Imperial forces. Wicket was
                            portrayed by actor Warwick Davis. <br><br>

                            Teebo is described by the Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary as being 'A watcher of
                            the stars and a poet at heart.' His ability to make a sound practical judgement has caused
                            him to have a position as a leader within the tribe. He wears a Gurreck skull headdress.
                            Teebo was portrayed by Jack Purvis. <br><br>

                            Chief Chirpa has been the leader of the Ewok tribe for a total of 42 seasons. He has a large
                            amount of wisdom and good judgement, but he has become forgetful due to his old age. He
                            allows the Ewok tribe the authority to fight against the Empire. Chief Chirpa has a
                            medallion signifying he is the chief of the Ewoks. Chirpa was played by Jane Busby. <br><br>

                            He is suspicious of all outsiders, which is reinforced due to the arrival of Imperial
                            troops. Logray was portrayed by Mike Edmonds who also was "tail-puppeteer" for Jabba the

                            Imperial scouts away from the bunker could have compromised the attack, it was relatively
                            successful as he stole a speeder bike and forced three of the scouts to give chase, allowing
                            the rebels to overpower the last guard and gain entrance. Paploo is seen later helping the
                            Ewoks fight the Empire. <br><br>

                            First appearance <br>
                            Literature: Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker (1976) <br>

                            Poor Greedo. No matter which way the ‚ÄúHan shot first‚Äù controversy plays out, the bug-eyed,
                            green-scaled Rodian bounty hunter looks bad. <br><br>

                            In the original Star Wars, when Jabba's henchman confronts Han over debts owed, he's the
                            classic talking killer, yammering threats long enough for his adversary to quietly unholster
                            his blaster and gun him down. <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-light">
                            Greedo is a Rodian bounty hunter working for Jabba the Hutt in Star Wars: A New Hope. Jabba
                            hires him to capture Han Solo, who lost the Hutt's cargo during a smuggling mission while
                            evading pursuit from an Imperial Star Destroyer. Greedo tracks his target to the Mos Eisley
                            cantina on Tatooine, where Han kills him with a concealed blaster. <br><br>

                            In the 1997 special edition, Greedo shoots first from across a small table and misses to the
                            right by half a foot. Either way, his ineptitude at Mos Eisley helps set a heroic course for
                            a fellow smuggler turned hero of the rebellion. But the controversy over his death has made
                            him immortal.

                            Created by George Lucas <br>
                            First appearance The Empire Strikes Back (1980) <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <P class="text-info"> Lando Calrissian: <br>
                            As played by Billy Dee Williams, Lando is a suaver Han Solo. Both are rogues, gamblers and
                            guns-for-hire who are philosophically inclined to stay out of galactic conflict unless the
                            price is right. <br><br>

                            But Han doesn't trust his old buddy, likely for the same reasons other might not trust him:
                            He mostly acts out of self-interest, not a sense of cosmic justice.

                            Sure enough, Darth Vader gets to Lando first in The Empire Strikes Back and he spends the
                            rest of the movie ‚Äî and Return of the Jedi ‚Äî heroically redeeming himself.

                            But the man is cool even at his most treacherous: The silk shirt, the matching cape, the
                            easy smile. Plus Cloud City looks fly. He can't be blamed for wanting to hold onto it.
